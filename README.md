## Features

1. **Cat vs Dog Classifier** - Dog Vs Cat classification is one of the standard and similar project done by enthusiasts of Deep learning. The basic model of this classification upon few enhancements can make highly accurate classifiers. In this project we tried to deploy our model on Android by the help of tensorflow lite. The Dog Vs  Cat classification is trained on the training set and deployed on Tf.lite

2. **Number Identifier** - Specially  abled people who can't speak communicate via hand signals. They have separate code for each word ,number and alphabet. To classify the numbers from 1-10 to make it easy for others as well this hard digit Recognizer is made. (Has Conflicts kindly see issues for the same)
